# QuizGame
A console game in which number of questions are asked and the user is awarded a cash prize for each correct answer given. Questions are chosen in such a way that they cover some fields of a typical quiz contest. The user’s general knowledge is tested with quiz questions regarding science, technology, movies, sports. We used STL Map and file orginations to Save the users’ name and their highest score in a file, so that when closing the program and reopening it the data still exists.
